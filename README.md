# Burger
Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's (or russian version - Piroshki) name, app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  App will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
